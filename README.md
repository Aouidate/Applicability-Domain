# Applicability-Domain
The AD is a theoretical region in the chemical space surrounding both the model descriptors and modeled response. In the construction of a QSAR model, the AD of molecules plays a deciding role in estimating the uncertainty in the prediction of a particular compound based on how similar it is to the compounds used to build the model. Therefore, the prediction of a modeled response using QSAR is applicable only if the compound being predicted falls within the AD of the model, as it is impractical to predict an entire universe of chemicals using a single QSAR model. Again, AD can be described as the physicochemical, structural, or biological space information based on which the training set of the model is developed, and the model is applicable to make predictions for new compounds within the specific domain.
